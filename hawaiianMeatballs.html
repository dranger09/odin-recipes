        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, juice reserved</li>
            <li>1/3 cup water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together ground beef, ginger, garlic powder, and pepper until well combined. Form into 1 1/2-inch meatballs.</li>
            <li>Saute meatballs in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove meatballs to a plate, reserving the pan drippings.</li>
            <li>While the meatballs are cooking, pour juice from the canned pineapple into a liquid measuring cup and add enough water to make 1 cup. Mix brown sugar and 
                cornstarch in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Add pineapple juice and brown sugar mixtures to the warm pan drippings. Add vinegar and soy sauce and bring to a boil. Cook until sauce thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Add meatballs, pineapple chunks, and green pepper. Simmer until meatballs are no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
